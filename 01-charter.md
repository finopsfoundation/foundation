# Charter

It is the primary mission of the FinOps Foundations Code of Conduct Committee (CoCC) to foster a community which exemplifies and practices the core values of the Foundation as stated in the Foundation’s Code of Conduct while exemplifying those values themselves. 

The Code of Conduct serves as the primary policy document and is supported with additional [references](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/about/code-of-conduct/#:~:text=Individuals%20who%20participate%20(or%20plan,whether%20before%2C%20during%20or%20after) and tools as needed. 

In areas where concerns of a deviation or infraction on these core values may arise, it is the responsibility of the Code of Conduct Committee to review these instances in an impartial manner and determine if a participant in the community has violated the Code of Conduct. Since maintaining a safe environment is a very large part of what the committee does, we must carefully balance transparency of process with preserving the privacy of all individuals involved when an incident report is made to this committee or to any other community leader.

The committee understands how challenging these matters are for everyone involved, and that the process is never perfect by nature of its need to serve everyone in the community equally. That said, the committee is oriented toward the protection of our community and takes that duty seriously.
