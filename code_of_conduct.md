## Inclusion

We are committed to providing a safe and productive environment that fosters open dialogue and the expression of ideas, free of harassment, discrimination, retaliation and hostile conduct.

All people are expected to treat others with respect and consideration. Generally, unethical, unlawful, unsafe, or other conduct that is otherwise inconsistent with FinOps Foundation's rules and policies, or that violates local, state or federal law is unacceptable. If we believe that you are not complying with this Code of Conduct, the matter will be carefully reviewed and the appropriate action will be taken.

## No Sales Pitches

FinOps Foundation is about sharing industry best practices, identifying the challenges that cloud poses and solutions that address them. While your products, tooling and business offerings may assist in solving some of these challenges we do not condone sales pitches. Unless there is a specific request about a product you are involved with, you should not continue to interject your offerings into conversation. **Violating participants will receive one warning, if there is another violation, the Governing Board may opt to remove all participants from the company from FinOps channels.**

##Defamation

Adding comments to the conversation about your competitors offerings, especially negative viewpoints will also not be accepted. We would like to keep the conversation positive and on point.

If you witness or are subjected to inappropriate behavior, or have concerns related to this Code of Conduct, please promptly contact hello@finops.org.
