# **Individual FinOps Foundation Access Criteria**

The Foundation offers different levels of individual access to our programs, resources and channels based primarily on your _**current**_ job role. To do this we vet every member via LinkedIn and require work email addresses.

The Community restrictions are intended to maintain value in the community by strongly encouraging involvement and input from those who practice FinOps, while still involving the important perspectives of those who consult or promote good FinOps practices.

1. Why are we introducing tiers of involvement?

- Transparency - we want everyone to know who everyone is when interacting with them
- Keep the community focused on the practitioner - encourage their involvement and participation
- Focus conversations on best practices and not on sales pitches

2. Why do we require certification for so many of these levels?

- We want as many people as possible in the community to be using the language and concepts of FinOps, so they can engage more meaningfully and deeply
- Practitioners may be working alone, we want them to have support regardless of training yet
- Vendors and consultants in particular should focus on tailoring messages to the community, not using their disparate or marketing language tied to their services

Note on sales roles: Individuals in a sales or business development position of any kind, or anyone who holds a quota (including bonuses based on sales revenue) may only hold a Supporter role in the Foundation. Examples of this would be Account Managers, Account Executives, Business Development reps, Pre-sales Engineers, Pre-sales Solution Architects, etc.

# Individual Community Requirements

## Practitioner

Practitioners perform FinOps functions or interact with FinOps teams in their primary job role. For [Practitioner Membership](https://www.finops.org/membership/practitioner/), individuals have to align to the [Practitioner definition](https://github.com/finopsfoundation/foundation/blob/master/practitioner_definition.md). This includes being employed or on a dedicated contract by the organisation whose cloud spend is being managed. We use a combination of LinkedIn title and work email address domain to vet this status. Before participating in the community, Practitioners must agree to the Code of Conduct and Linux Foundation policies.

## Consultant

Consultants who sell and/or provide services to other organizations can apply for a [Consultant](https://www.finops.org/membership/consultants/) access. They must have completed the [code of conduct training](https://learn.finops.org/finops-code-of-conduct), plus hold a valid [FinOps Certified Practitioner](https://learn.finops.org/) qualification to maintain access and no more than three (3) individual members are permitted from the same organisation. Consultant organizations with a [Partner membership](https://www.finops.org/membership/vendor/) in the Foundation will be allowed more (though not unlimited) members. Individual Consultant Membership will have limited scope in the Foundation Slack, limited to one (1) simultaneous working group participation and may be subject to limited participation at certain events to maintain balance in overall attendance.

## Consultant Plus

Those who are already approved for Consultant access can further apply for Consultant Plus. This level gives full access to Slack in parity to Practitioner designation but still limits working group participation and maximum number of individual members permitted from the same organisation (3). Consultant Plus is based on previous practitioner experience and contractor team members, Foundation involvement and positive behavior in the community, and continuing contributions to the framework and Foundation materials (For example: previously worked as a FinOps practitioner for one company, but has transitioned to a contractor performing FinOps support work for multiple companies while contributing to the Foundation). Applications will be reviewed by Foundation staff, then passed to the [Foundation Ambassadors](https://www.finops.org/ambassadors/). If supported by at least five Ambassadors membership will be accepted, it will also be reviewed at times to make sure the criteria is maintained. As with Consultant access a valid [FinOps Certified Practitioner](https://learn.finops.org/) qualification must be maintained.

## Supporters

Anyone may be a Supporter of the FinOps Foundation. There are no limitations on being a designated a [supporter](https://www.finops.org/membership/supporter/). Supporters receive email updates and public event invitations but will have no default access to the Foundation slack or working groups.

 For example industry analysts can be [supporters](https://www.finops.org/membership/supporter/) of the Foundation to receive updates and attend public events. They can also liaise with the analyst relations team to get individual updates and insights from the FinOps community.

## Educational Supporter

Individuals who apply for Educational access must be a student, teacher, professor, or other education professional and not hold any other conflicting roles aligned in the [Practitioner definition](https://github.com/finopsfoundation/foundation/blob/master/practitioner_definition.md). Educational Supporters must hold a valid [FinOps Certified Practitioner](https://learn.finops.org/) qualification to maintain membership. Note, the [Foundation's scholarship program](https://learn.finops.org/finops-foundation-scholarship-program/1212336/scorm/kmv1bysbj0rk)[is available to help students achieve certification in many cases.](https://learn.finops.org/finops-foundation-scholarship-program/1212336/scorm/kmv1bysbj0rk) Once employed, members should switch to a different access category.

## Public

Anyone who does not hold any status to the requirements can freely access information on the [Foundations website](https://www.finops.org/), Github and other public documentation areas. They can also access any of the public [events](https://www.finops.org/community/events/) or [meetups](https://events.finops.org/). Any participation in public events requires an agreement to abide by the Code of Conduct.

# Linux Foundation Membership

## Partner Member

These are organizations which provide FinOps related tooling, platform and services vendors which are members of the Foundation under [Partner membership](https://www.finops.org/membership/vendor/). Individuals from this organization may be permitted to join the community. These individuals must have a subject matter expert status (examples: product leader, relevant engineering or consultancy), they must hold a valid [FinOps Certified Practitioner](https://learn.finops.org/) qualification to maintain individual access and have completed the [code of conduct training](https://learn.finops.org/finops-code-of-conduct). Under the Partner Membership, companies are also allowed relevant marketing members to coordinate partner membership benefits, but these individuals are restricted and must not communicate with the community nor take part in working groups. A fair usage limit may be applied to attendance at certain events to maintain a balance in the community.

## Enterprise Member

Organizations who join the [Enterprise membership](https://www.finops.org/membership/enterprise/) will fall into existing categories, such as Practitioners or Supporters and the same criteria applies.

## Changes to Access

If any individual changes job roles in a way that impacts individual access criteria, individuals should notify the Foundation immediately at [hello@finops.org](mailto:hello@finops.org). The Foundation reserves the right to adjust access levels for any type of community supporter, if required based on current or future published community or membership criteria.
