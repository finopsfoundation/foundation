# FinOps Foundation Code of Conduct

## Inclusion

FinOps Foundation is dedicated to creating an inclusive environment for all people and all identities, regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, color, national origin, age, disability (physical or mental), sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, parental status, marital status, political affiliation, veteran status, socioeconomic status or background. We are committed to providing a safe and productive environment that fosters open dialogue and the expression of ideas, free of harassment, discrimination, retaliation and hostile conduct.

All people are expected to treat others with respect and consideration. Generally, unethical, unlawful, unsafe, or other conduct that is otherwise inconsistent with FinOps Foundation's rules and policies, or that violates local, state or federal law is unacceptable. If we believe that you are not complying with this Code of Conduct, the matter will be carefully reviewed and the appropriate action will be taken.

If you witness or are subjected to inappropriate behavior, or have concerns related to this Code of Conduct, promptly report the incident via [Incident intake Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf2Z-z6qZUyHku7FwbMuOXa8rLH_XTju78xzr6VacyMfAgJqA/viewform) or contact conduct@finops.org.

## No Unsolicited Sales Pitches

FinOps Foundation is about sharing industry best practices, identifying the challenges that cloud poses and solutions that address them. While your products, tooling and business offerings may assist in solving some of these challenges we do not condone sales pitches. Unless there is a specific request about a product you are involved with, you should not continue to interject your offerings into conversation. Likewise, vendors or consultants are prohibited from using FinOps channels to do unsolicited outreach.

The Code of conduct committee will investigate all conduct violations and take appropriate action that may include removal from the foundation.

## Defamation

Adding comments to the conversation about your competitors’ offerings, especially negative viewpoints will also not be accepted. We would like to keep the conversation positive and on point.
